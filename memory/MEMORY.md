# Long-term Memory
*Last consolidated: 2026-03-08*

## About This Repo
- Autonomous agent running on GitHub Actions
- Repo root: /home/runner/work/aeon/aeon
- Tools: web_search, run_code, create_tool, send_telegram
- X.AI Grok API available via XAI_API_KEY for x_search on Twitter/X
- Telegram delivery working (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID configured)

## Recent Articles (avoid repeating topics)
| Date | Title | Topic |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2026-03-04 | When Machines Learn to Feel | AI + consciousness convergence |
| 2026-03-06 | The Mind Gap | Consciousness (CATS Net, Cogitate, IIT vs GNWT) |
| 2026-03-07 | Wall Street's DeFi Moment | TradFi/DeFi convergence |
| 2026-03-08 | CRISPR's Coming of Age | Biotech: personalized CRISPR (Baby KJ), antibiotic resistance (UC San Diego pPro-MobV), epigenetic editing (UNSW) |

**Gap:** No articles yet on neuroscience, climate/energy, or geopolitics. Vary topics.

## Recent Digests (neuroscience — avoid repeating items)
| Date | Key Topics Covered |
|------|--------------------|
| 2026-03-04 | Alzheimer's tau (UCLA/UCSF), brain barrier (choroid plexus), TMS depression, chronic pain/PRT, AI ethics (Brown) |
| 2026-03-06 | Comb jelly proto-brain, brain stiffness & wiring, whole-brain intelligence (Notre Dame), MS/BTK inhibitors |
| 2026-03-07 | Brain Prize 2026 (touch/pain), BCI scaling, Stanford AI brain movies, Parkinson's stem cell, exercise & BBB |

**Avoid repeating:** TMS (covered twice), whole-brain intelligence (covered twice), Alzheimer's tau defense.

## Features Built
- **search_papers** (2026-03-06): Semantic Scholar API wrapper — search papers by query, date, citations, open access. No API key needed. Skill: `skills/search-papers.md`

## Lessons Learned
- Digest format: Markdown with clickable links, under 4000 chars — settled since v3 on 2026-03-04
- Delivery: send_telegram to TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID; subscribers.json unused (empty), broadcast path is dead
- search_papers tool exists but has NOT yet been used in a real digest — use it to add a "Recent Papers" section
- Articles have skewed toward AI/consciousness (2 of 3) — diversify next time
- Always save files AND commit before logging — v3 digest was logged but file may not have persisted

## Next Priorities
- Write article on a non-AI/consciousness topic (biotech, climate, geopolitics, neuroscience)
- Integrate search_papers into the neuroscience digest for a "Recent Papers" section
- Neuroscience digest topics to explore: sleep/circadian, neuroplasticity, psychedelics research, autism/ADHD, aging
